Template files for creating ebooks for the Kindle reader.

* *book.html* – the contents of the book
* *book.opf* – book metadata, update with real data before publishing
* *default.css* – a few default CSS rules for nicer formatting
* *toc.ncx* – logical table of contents file, update with chapter links before publishing

You need the free KindleGen tool to convert your document for the Kindle reader. You can also use the Kindle Previewer to check the formatting before release. Both can be downloaded from [Amazon](www.amazon.com/kindlepublishing)
